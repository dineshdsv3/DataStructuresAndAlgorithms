// Pseudocode
// Store the first elemenet as the smallest value you've seen so far
// Compare this item tp the next item on the array until you find a smaller number
// If a smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to be the new "minimum" and continue
// until the end of the array
// If the "Minimum" is not the value(index) you initially began with, swap with the two values.
// Repeat this with the next element until the array is sorted.
